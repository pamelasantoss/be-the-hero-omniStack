# OmniStack Week || Be The Hero

Be The Hero is an application developed with React and SQL that aims to register an ONG and than list all the causes that need help. It's just a prototype, but it helped me to learn new things and to have more desire to do nice things in my job.

The OmniStack Week from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) helped me to develop this amazing application with React, API, Node, Express, SQL and React Native.

I use the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to run the enviroment react in the machine.
